Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me

2019,Bad Guy,Billie Eilish,True,"White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul, so cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm-I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad-",,

Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree

And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights

And everybody raised 'em high, singin'

With the ocean color stuck in your iris
We comfortable in silence
But I prefer it when we wildin'
Sundress, nothing underneath as we undress (woo)

Couple of broken people
Tryna complete each other under one breath

Over the death of George Floyd
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)
Trade my 4 x 4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again
I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead
But still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better
You gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones
To carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us

Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up

They know that we can storm any weather

I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to

I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope
But I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope
I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains

What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe

I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace

Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all

2020,If The World Was Ending,JP Saxe Featuring Julia Michaels,True,"I was distracted
And in traffic
I didn't feel it
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
Were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room
Chillin' watchin' television?

Think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out
I know, you know, we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine

You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?

2020,Snow On Tha Bluff,J. Cole,True,"Niggas be thinkin' I'm deep, intelligent, fooled by my college degree
My IQ is average, there's a young lady out there, she way smarter than me
I scrolled through her timeline in these wild times, and I started to read
She mad at these crackers, she mad at these capitalists, mad at these murder police
She mad at my niggas, she mad at our ignorance, she wear her heart on her sleeve
She mad at the celebrities, lowkey I be thinkin' she talkin' 'bout me
Now I ain't no dummy to think I'm above criticism
So when I see something that's valid, I listen
But shit, it's something about the queen tone that's botherin' me
She strike me as somebody blessed enough to grow up in conscious environment
With parents that know 'bout the struggle for liberation and in turn they provide her with
A perspective and awareness of the system and unfairness that afflicts 'em
And the clearest understandin' of what we gotta do to get free
And the frustration that fills her words seems to come from the fact that most people don't see
Just 'cause you woke and I'm not, that shit ain't no reason to talk like you better than me
How you gon' lead?
When you attackin' the very same niggas that really do need the shit that you sayin'?
Instead of conveying you holier, come help get us up to speed
Shit, it's a reason it took like two hundred years for our ancestors just to get freed
These shackles be lockin' the mental way more than the physical
I look at freedom like trees, can't grow a forest like overnight
Hit the ghetto and slowly start plantin' your seeds
Fuck is the point of you preaching your message to those that already believe what you believe?
I'm on some ""Fuck a retweet, "" most people is sheep
You got all the answers but how you gon' reach?
If I could make one more suggestion respectfully
I would say it's more effective to treat people like children
Understandin' the time and love and patience that's needed to grow
This change is inevitable but ain't none of us seen this before
Therefore we just gotta learn everything as we go
I struggle with thoughts on the daily
Feel like a slave that somehow done saved enough coins to buy his way up outta slavery
Thinkin' just maybe, in my pursuit to make life so much better for me and my babies
I done betrayed the very same people that look at me like I'm some kind of a hero
Because of the zeros that's next to the commas
But look here, I promise I'm not who you think
Ran into this nigga outside of the store yesterday
He said something that had me like, ""Wait""
He was like ""Cole, 'preciate what you been doin', my nigga, that's real""
But damn, why I feel faker than Snow on Tha Bluff?
Well maybe 'cause deep down I know I ain't doing enough
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
The sun is shinin' today
Can you walk with me?
I hope we'll find the reason why we often sob, go on cry
Painful memories fuck up the vibe
Though I be tryna let the time heal my mind
I was once a child, I've gotten older
Still, I know I'm just a boy in God's eyes

Can't you just use me like I'm using you?

There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
I don't want a number, you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards
Well, I ain't Cinderella, but who is?
Call me what you want if the shoe fits
I ain't gonna say I never do this, 'cause truth is
Lonely makes a heart ruthless
Ain't nobody gonna hurt nobody
Ain't nothing wrong with needing somebody
You can leave all that

Guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer
Had a smallmouth on the line

And as I reeled him in

Huh
I spent way less time in Nashville
And more time in L.A.

Thought I had too much on my plate
But last night we cracked some cold beers
And cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Yeah, I love me some California
But it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia
Yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done
Or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again
I traded in my Silverado
Didn't need no four by four
Tucked my boots in the back of the closet
They didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on
They've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

And my roots down there in Georgia
Yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done
Or the places that I've been

I traded sunsets with my wife
For hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her
I still wasn't really home
But last night we built a fire
Watched the moonlight kiss her skin

Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation

Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, why the fuck would you say that?
You can do it first, I'ma do it worse, gotta double the payback
Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally, see what it means to be living
See, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his

She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him""

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way

And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

Tiene novio y no se comporta
Me dice: ""tranqui, que la relación 'ta rota""
Nuestros cuerpos chocan y chocan
Se juntan las bocas, los leggings le ahorcan
Quiere que le ponga música

Le pones música y solita se excita
Pa' la fiesta nunca se limita
Par de amigas, completa la cuadrilla
Pero tú, mamá, sabes, me mamas
Loca, ven pa'cá, pégate hasta atrás
Nos vamos tú y yo en un viaje fugaz
Interestellar, comerte toda
Fumaremos los dos marihuana
En el cuarto, en la azotea y en mi cama
Nena, creo te llaman, contesta mañana
Que no se apague la flama
Llama a los bomberos, que el cuarto se va a incendiar
De tanto calor creo que nos vamos a desmayar

And if your touch shattered me like glass
I'd be in pieces trying to make the breaking last
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway
I know just trying to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm trying to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight
And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway
