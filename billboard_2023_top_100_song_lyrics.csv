2023,Last Night,Morgan Wallen,True,"Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip, yeah
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit, I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me
I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh, baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again
But baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)
No way it was our last night (last night, last night)",,
2023,Fast Car,Luke Combs,True,"You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally, see what it means to be living
See, my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him""
So, I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way
So, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs
So, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving
So, I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough, so you can fly away?
You still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way",,

Lately, I just wanna show up and body some shit, yeah, yeah
Always been a lil' mathematician, lately it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harrassed

I decided I had to finish, but the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (no, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still on deploy
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt they self

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
'Cause the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO, how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me, but I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself, this shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance
All pistons firin'
I be stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes, all day in my room
Thinkin', ""Damn, this shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks, I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview
Most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age
All my life (all my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (they been tryin' to keep me down)

2023,Anti-Hero,Taylor Swift,True,"I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror

Olvida ya el ayer
Hace un mes
También te quería ver
Tienes que entender
No queremo' reconocer
Una y otra vez
Cometimos errores que
No se arreglan ya
Cuento de nunca ya acabar
Vamos a aceptar
Tú por aquí, yo por allá
Te recordaré
Por siempre en mi vida, bebé
Y aunque ya lo sé
Que nunca ya te podré ver
Y eso que
Pues te amo, bebé
Te llevé a Chanel
También escogió de Cartier
Y un día se me fue
Para un día nunca ya volver
Se me fue, eh
No sé qué hacer
Tienes que entender
No queremos reconocer
Una y otra vez
Cometimos errores que
No se arreglan ya
Cuento de nunca ya acabar
Vamos a aceptar
Tú por aquí, yo por allá
